# Sprint 7 project
This project was used to test the codes of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The terminal was used with different handles to pinpoint
what was required. Handles such as npx jest deleteHandlers.test.js, npx jest putHandlers.test.js, npx jest postHandlers.test.js and,  
npx jest getHandlers.test.js were used in VS code. They were placed in the terminal to find the desired (?) result.
Git Bash was also used to make sure the file was in the system and everything was okay.
In order to run the tests, you must have vs code opened. Go to config.js and put a fresh server link. Then save this so it can work across ALL of the codes that you will be using. Make sure you have a proper end point. After this, make sure your code is written as best as possible, then click on the 3 dots located above. The press 'terminal'. You will then enter a handle such as npx jest getHandlers.test.js and then press enter and run your test.
